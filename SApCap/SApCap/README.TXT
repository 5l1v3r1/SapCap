Usage:

java -jar SApCap.jar

Please note: The JNI libraries required for the platform must be kept in ./lib.

Should you compile your own JNI libs or make modifications, please refer to the com.sensepost.SAPProx.jni.JniInterface class to adjust the dynamic library routines.

Finally, you will also need to install the Jpcap library.  Downloads and instructions for your operating system are available from: http://netresearch.ics.uci.edu/kfujii/Jpcap/doc/index.html
